**IMPORTANT** : The Plugin doesn't support symbols currently. The button needs to be a group containing only two layers i.e background and text.


## Installation

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/infinitegarg/infinite-button/releases) and double-click the `.sketchplugin` file to install.


## How to use
Create a group containing background and text. Select it and use `Cmd + J` to open the plugin.
Alternatively, access the plugin from Plugins > Infinite Button > Button


## Additional Info
**WIP:** 
- Seperate file for default configuration.
- Support for symbols
